<h3>Here is where I'm excited to be making blog posts to update you on what's going on in my life.</h3>

	As of right now, I'm currently building this website to where I want from scratch. I'm so excited for you to see my progress as we go along! I only know basic HTML and CSS at the moment, so this will be a test for me and I couldn't be more excited to work toward completion! I'll have to figure out how to post updates with dates at some point but in the meantime I'll have to enter them manually. Trying to get the framework for what I want before I finish adding everything and we'll go from there.
