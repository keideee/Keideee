<h1>Keideee's Website</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my page! (Plz excuse - currently under construction. Thank you! ❤️ UwU)</h3>

<p>
	Welcome to my website! Here is where I will share things such as my favorite clips, links to websites to purchase merch, links to my social media platforms, a blog for anything going on in my life and any upcoming plans. This will be a work in progress for awhile since I am building all of this with HTML code myself! <3 Please bare with me while I get everything up and running.
</p>

	The merch is a work in progress as it stands currently, the last site I went through did not print in a way that I was very thrilled about. So I am looking for a different company to work with . Worst case scenario I will rework some designs and see if I can get them screen printed locally & ship them myself.
