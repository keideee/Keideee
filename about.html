<p>
	Feel like you don't know enough yet? I can dive in a little more! I was born & raised on video games in California. My dad introduced me to Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega genesis when I was somewhere in my toddler stages and the love only grew from there. I grew up playing games on the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Playstation 2, Xbox, & Xbox 360. There were 4 of us kids growing up in the house, so one of our favorite past-times were killing eachother on Halo. The 4-player split screen mode where half the game was everyone yelling at our brother for screen-cheating. (For anyone wondering, when I go home to visit family & we play, he still screen cheats). 
</p>
<p>
	There was a brief pause from around 2010 to mid 2013 (most of which I don't remember to be honest, thank you PTSD, it was a big learning period for myself). I married my best friend from high school later in 2013 after dating long distance for a few months and I moved to a small town in North Dakota where he was living for work. He helped me rediscover my love for games as I was finding myself again and I haven't looked back. We had made some amazing friends and had plenty of adventures! I have enough stories to write a book (I probably won't, because who wants to read about drama, hah!), and moved down to another small town in Texas for his job. During that time we decided to divorce & still remain best friends and game as often as life allows us. 
</p>
<p>
	I moved back in with familiy in California for about 6 months before going to visit another best friend for his graduation and road tripped back to the small town in North Dakota where I received a job offer from a supervisor (and incredible friend, basically family,) I used to work for. I was so ecstatic that I took the position and packed up my car (with what I could, I was driving a Ford Fusion) when I got back home and drove from California back to North Dakota to start my new job! 
</p>

	During my 7 or so months in North Dakota a lot happened, which led me to move to Maryland with my new husband after my lease was up on the apartment in May of 2020.  Right after getting my apartment, I was surprised with a pregnancy. Me and my best friend, the one I went to visit for graduation, got married. We were so excited, even if things were moving faster than planned! We weren't super concerned, since we had already been friends for a few years by this point and things already clicked well for us. About 2 weeks after he left I ended up miscarrying, at least that was what I thought. After a trip to the emergency room for abdominal pains, a blood draw & an ultrasound, they determined I had an ectopic pregnancy. Anyone not familiar, an ectopic pregnancy is when the egg implants anywhere outside the uterus. Mine had implanted inside my right falopian tube and was getting ready to burst. At that point I had been contemplating moving in with my new husband sooner than planned (since I had just gotten my job a month or so before, I was planning to stick around and do the long-distance relationship thing for awhile). About 8 days later I was involved in a car accident that solidified my decision to follow behind after my lease was up. The decision to leave when I did ended up being for the best, as I'm sure I would have taken a demotion or lost my job amidst Covid-19 & management transitions after our other location closed down. I'm still adjusting to the population change from small town North Dakota to Maryland but we're getting there.

	I started streaming sometime during fall of 2017, right before the move to Texas, after the location I had been working at shut down. I had no idea how fun it would be and the amazing people I would meet & connect with along the way and I'm so thankful for all of it. I fell off the wagon quite a bit sometime in 2018 after a concussion I ended up with, and even moreso after I moved back home to California. Everything since then has been sporadic, especially with trying to balance my full time job here in Maryland now & still dealing with some mental health issues from my car accident in winter of 2019. The car accident was 21 December 2019, I was living alone at the time. My new husband had just moved to Maryland for work at the beginning of the month, and my roommate was still away for work. (There's a whole other story in the middle of all this.) I was driving home from work around 10:50pm and I was hit from behind from a speeding drunk driver. I've heard mixed information, but it was passed along that he was at a .18 BAC. Scary! He hit me with such speed that he pushed my vehicle (only going around 25-30mph) into the semi truck in front of me (there was at least a car length of space between me and the semi prior to collision). The icy roads aboslutely contributed to this, but it doesn't make it less scary. I never did find out what happened other than he got arrested and that the city was going after him for drinking and driving. I'm still scared to drive to this day, but things have been improving and I'm excited for it. With these improvements I've seen positive changes in my meantal health and I'm excited to see where we go from here. Which is why I'm building this site. Working on a project to completion and having something to be excited and proud of.

	I hope this has helped give you a little more insight to my life and who I am!
